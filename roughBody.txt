Road Extraction Methods:
In spite of the fact that many researchers have differentiated the road extraction methods,
even then it is challenging to differentiate these methods particularly because of their
diverse applications.
After our survey we find that most of the proposals suggested multiple algorithms among these:
Deep Residual (U-net), Dense Global Residual Network, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, U-net, U-net++,
D-LinkNet, AD-LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, Coord-Dense-Global(CDG), CNN, ResNet, ResNeXt, RCNN-Unet, Generative Adversarial Network
Beginning with classifying works based on automation, Hormese[a] says automatic extraction of roads are more compound than semi-automatic extractions. As for the difference between these two, the automatic extraction methods needs some essential support and information while semi-automation just gives result on the basis of input details. Considering these approaches, one such method that suggests use of semi-automation is the Vectorization method to extract roads[a]. In the automated version, roads are converted into road vectors. But this approach faced failure in terms of full automation. Hence, semi-automation was advised in such scenarios. Apart from this, active contour models, called snake models (ziplock snake ...) are employed for the purpose of semi-automatic extraction. The disadvantage here is that human assistance is required to perform the computation. Also, approximations with rigorous calculations must be fed to the program. The vectorization approach turned out to correctly work on input that comprised of rural areas as these are lesser compound and have little to no obstacles or occlusions. Active Contour Model is one of the approaches used when it comes to employ road extraction in terms of semi-automation. Here starting seed points have to be given to guess the roads. Then the trick is to plot the graph lines between seed points.
Keeping the automation and semi-automation on the shelf and having a look at extraction from only urban areas, Miao[b] proposed information fusion technique suitable for this sake. From the perspective of urban region, it is very strenous to guess the roads, since they may be intevened by the trees, its shadows, the shadows of constructed joints and buildings. The proposed idea was very helpful in this scenario.
In referece with transport fusion technique, another work proposed a road structure refined convolutional neural network[c], which comprised of designed both deconv and fusion layers. The authors also constructed a loss function which they called road-structure-based loss function mainly to assimilate or include the geometric description of the road in cross entropy loss. This loss function is the first and single in the the world solely for road extraction through CNN models. The objective of this loss function is to make use of each different pixel's minimum yet direct distance to the road area to create a weight graph.
Now taking into account that the training dataset of the deep CNN will be shortened or converted to a fixed size, leading to the roads being run through every sample, and that roads differ with their width size, Yongyang et el.[d] proposed densely connected neural network or DenseNet. The authors of this project derived their work majorly from the concept of symmetric architecture of the u-net, which will be covered in the latter part of the paper. Hence they also called this model as GL-Dense-U-Net. Though the model was challenged for extracting roads that came under complex terrains. After testing, they arrived to the conclusion that DenseNet extracted more information, allowing greater pixel classification. Comparing with the then state of the art model viz. U-net, they saw that u-net model achieved higher recall values, but outperformed u-net in other all cases.
When it comes to image segmentation or semantic segmentation, U-net is probably one of the most recognised or used technologies. Pertaining to get a more accurate result it is principal to use details of lower level while considering semanticc information of higher level. But anyways to train such a deep neural network is a very tedious and difficult task given that the training data is scanty. Here we can apply data augmentation, as done in U-net. Not only data augmentation, the U-net also helps to ease the training problem. Zhang et al.[d] suggested that the working of U-net can be further enhanced by replacing the plain unit with residual unit. The model that these authors created, they called it the Deep ResUnet. It composed of combination of strengths of both U-Net and residual neural networks or ResNet. Now this also introduces the ideology of skip connections which will clear the way for propagation of information both in backward and forward computations. This makes the model very powerful.
